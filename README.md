## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stocky-mcp.git
cd stocky-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development Checks

Run lint and type checks from the repo root:

```bash
make lint
```

That runs:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m flake8 . && .venv/bin/python -m pyrefly check
```

### API Key Setup

You'll need free API keys from each provider:

1. **Pexels** 📷 - Get your key at [pexels.com/api](https://www.pexels.com/api/)
2. **Unsplash** 🌅 - Sign up at [unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
3. **Pixabay** 🖼️ - Get your key at [pixabay.com/api/docs](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)


### API Key Configuration

You'll need to configure your API keys when setting up the MCP server. These keys are used to authenticate with the stock image providers.

### Running as an MCP Server

Stocky is designed to be run as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, not as a standalone application. It should be configured in your MCP client configuration.

## 🔧 MCP Client Configuration

Add Stocky to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stocky": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/stocky_mcp.py"],
      "env": {
        "PEXELS_API_KEY": "your_pexels_key",
        "UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY": "your_unsplash_key",
        "PIXABAY_API_KEY": "your_pixabay_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Deploying on Vercel

This repo also exposes a no-auth Streamable HTTP MCP server for Vercel.

1. Set these Vercel environment variables:
```bash
PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_key
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_key
PIXABAY_API_KEY=your_pixabay_key
```

2. Deploy the repo to Vercel.

3. Connect MCP clients to:
```text
https://your-project.vercel.app/mcp
```

The root URL returns a small health response. The `/mcp` route is the MCP
endpoint. Because this deployment has no auth, anyone with the URL can use the
server and spend requests against your provider API keys.
